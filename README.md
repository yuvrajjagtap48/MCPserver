📌 Project Overview
This project introduces a powerful backend system — the MCP Server — that revolutionizes how users interact with X (formerly Twitter). With a simple natural-language prompt, the MCP Server generates intelligent social media content and posts it automatically, eliminating the need for manual tweeting or social copywriting.

Whether you're a solo creator, a brand strategist, or a developer exploring AI + social media integration, this project proves how minimal input can yield maximum influence.

⚙️ What Is the MCP Server?
MCP stands for Message Control Protocol, and in this project, it functions as a custom AI-powered server that connects:

1. A prompt processor (like GPT or LLM)
2. A content optimizer (tone, emotion, hashtags, formatting)
3. A Twitter/X posting API handler
It becomes your AI social media manager, turning high-level thoughts into polished posts that go live instantly.

🧠 How It Works (Behind the Scenes)
1. ✅ Input Prompt: You send a single-line idea to the server (e.g., “post something motivational about coding”).

2. 🧠 AI-Generated Content: The server uses an LLM to generate a tweet-ready post, enriched with hashtags, tone, and context.

3. 📤 Post to X (Twitter): The server connects to the X API (v2) using secure OAuth tokens and instantly posts the content.
